----------------------------------------------------
- Primary site link updated to: https://www.quirksubaruma.com
- Netlify preview/site placeholder: https://quirksubarutrade.netlify.app (you can change this in Netlify)
- All visible "Quirk Ford" strings replaced with "Quirk Subaru"
- Success page CTA updated to return to Quirk Subaru

Deployment checklist:
1) Create a new GitHub repo (e.g., quirk-trade-appraisal-subaru) and push this folder.
2) In Netlify, create a new site from that repo. Suggested site name: quirksubarutrade.
3) In index.html & success/index.html, verify links and dealership logo if you want a Subaru-specific asset.
4) Test English/Spanish toggles; success page should match the selected language.
